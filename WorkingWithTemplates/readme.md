# Work with templates
This repository is just "toy code" to article [Building templates to dotnet new command (pt-br only)](https://www.blogdoft.com.br/2021/03/04/criando-templates-para-dotnet-new/)

I wanna say "thank you" to @timheuer and @sayedihashimi fo the help tha made it possible for me to write this article to portuguese readers.
Maybe you wanna see the @sayedihashimi works (I advice it). [So, just open his repository!](https://github.com/sayedihashimi/template-sample). You will see more tips and examples there.

And should go to [ASP.Net Core Project Templates repository](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/main/src/ProjectTemplates) too to see others examples with more complexity.

Be welcome to use, distribute, fork and improve this repo!
